I am making progress everyday.
  
Today I reviewed some subjects in JAVA , including JAVA exceptions, threads, and I also get to learn some C++: container is today’s subject. Some of my friends just think it ridiculous that I, who is one of the top students in the class, am doing such…kind of naive staff. They think these techniques are simple and I am supposed to deal with some really challenging problems.
  
Well, I think in another way. I don’t find it stupid learning these fundamental techniques. They are basic, but not naive. Every time I read such classic books, I attain some new knowledge or feelings that I never have got. I will keep doing such “stupid”things over and over again.
  
This afternoon I watched a moive named Marry and Max. The story moves me indeed and I really love the interlude
 Whatever will be, will be,which is also known as Que Sera, Sera in ancient Spanish.
