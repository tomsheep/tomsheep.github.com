From this day onwards, I will keep a diary in English on my blog, in order to improve my writing technique.

These days I spent a lot of time on the opengl stuff, and I find it fascinating to program in the manner of Computer Graphics. If I choose to stay in Fudan for my master’s degree, I think I will take it as my direction of research. As I love programming as well as math, they have a prefect marriage in CG.

Mogan Stanley is recruiting for summer interns. Sounds very attractive, isn’t it? I wound like to have a try, though I hardly believe I can make it. Sometims I wonder, if I had not taken the wrong way from the very first and wasted so much time, I wound have been strong enough and I wound be more confident. This morning I read a weblog of my classmate, he just felt regret for his sluggish as a freshman. I know very well that he is a great guy, smart, cute, talented in Computer Science… Well, you see, to err is human. What can I complain about any more? Just do the best, prepare for the worst.

I will practice my public speaking and programming skills hardly, for gods sake.
