Finally I finished the book C++ Primier 4ed as expected. I found that C++ is a so complex language, just like a federation of many sub-languages. But it is powerful anyway, and I think I will deperately fall in love with it.
  
I came to realize that only a primier book was far from enough, so a few hours ago I searched the Internet and got quite a few ebooks on C++, all of which are considered as classic tutorials or even Bibles in this field. Hmmm…you see, it is still a long way to become a practitioner of C++.
  
Acctually, at the very beginning I was just eager to get a brief knowledge of C++, in order to deal with the forthcoming written tests and interviews. However, now I have decided that I will step into this fascinating language and try hard to be a master in it. Well, that will take quite a lot of time and I must not be too hurry.
  
On the other hand, I would not stop the preparation as planned, including C#, Python, Network and so on.
  
PS. Almost forget to say, I bought a 1TB-hard disk today for my exploding resourses, most are ebooks, video clips and softwares. :)
