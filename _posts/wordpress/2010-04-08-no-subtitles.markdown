These days I have watched a lot of American movies and TV series to improve my English listening comprehension, and it works. 
  
At the very begining, I had to follow the Chinese subtitles to make sure what the characters were talking about. And a few days later, the subtitles went to be Chinese-English ones. While as time went by, it was the pure English subtitles that I needed to follow. What a fantastic progress!
  
And today I just went along with an American comedy, Step Brothers for its name, without subtitles! The fact is I did not find any proper subtitles for it, but it was really cool that I finally made it! God!
  
Today is also a big day for my roomate, little piggy, it is his 21st birthday, and we guys went out for dinner to celebrate it. That’s great.
