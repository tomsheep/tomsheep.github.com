Yestday I took the written test held by Morgen Stanley. Actually the examination paper did not make me feel happy. The questions were not very difficult but I realised that I just had not been prepared for it. I definely believe that I should have done better.
  
Well, optimistically speaking, I don’t think that there are many candicates doing a much better job than mine. I believe, or just hope that I am supposed to step into next round.
  
These days I will review some courses and techniques that I have learned for these years, such as Java, C++, OOP, etc. I think I will benefit for the application.
