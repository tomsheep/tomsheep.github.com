I learned some mechanisms in C++ like templates and polymorphism today, which are elements of this language and certainlly challenging to understand. And it was a little bitter to find that I had done some subjects totally wrong in the written test once I come to know these techniques. Hmm…haha.
  
Well, I will finish the book C++ Primier tomorrow, if everything goes well, as today. I must do some preparation for the interview things, such as getting familiar with the company I want to join and the position I want to apply. It is really important to make a good prepraration before the interview or written test. Although this lesson I learned from the written test last week is costly indeed, I think it is beneficial for me and it will never be too late to realise it.
