Today I reviewed some subjects of the written test last Saturday, and redid them. 
  
In the past I usually resisted to review subjects of examinations I had taken, because I thouht that it had already gone and any review was just useless and stupid.
  
But things changed. Now I believe it will figure out in which aspect I need to improve, and remind me of never being lazy and arrogant. This will be a new convention of me and is supposed to do me good in the long run.
