Today one of my classmates came to tell me that he just got the phone interview permission of Morgan Stanley. I felt great pain in my heart because I got nothing yet. I admit that I did a really bad job in the written test, but it still hurt when I got the news that someone around me passed it.
  
Well, I don’t know whether I will get the the permission later. I hope I will be lucky enough to get an opportunity to express myself in next round, but if not, I will accept anyway and go on to fight for the future.
