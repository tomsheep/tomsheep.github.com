It is a pleasure to meet some old friends and talk about anything and nothing. Today some classmates and I got together again to have a dinner in a Xinjiang restaurant, with some of them just having returned from aboard. I tried to speak a lot in the dinner, which appears to be a challenge for me. Most of them found it unbelievable that I had become so “outgoing”, and I was also excited that I can behave this way. It makes me feel great.
